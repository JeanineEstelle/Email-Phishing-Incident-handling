# Phishing Incident Handling Project

## Project Overview
This project demonstrates the process of detecting and responding to phishing email incidents. It covers identifying phishing signs in emails, analyzing suspicious links, and containing the threat.

## Objective
The goal is to handle a phishing email security incident from detection to eradication, using tools such as:
- **Netcraft**: Used to check if links in emails are phishing websites.
- **PhishTank**: Used to verify if URLs in the email are phishing sites.
- **MxToolbox**: Used to verify the authenticity of email senders.
- **RMail**: Used for secure email encryption.

## Steps to Follow:
1. **Identify phishing signs** in an email (e.g., mismatched sender address, suspicious links).
2. **Analyze the email** using Netcraft, MxToolbox, and PhishTank.
3. **Contain the incident** by isolating the affected machine and blocking the phishing links.
4. **Report the phishing email** for further investigation.

## Tools Used:
- **Netcraft**: Checks the legitimacy of a link.
- **PhishTank**: Verifies if the link is a known phishing site.
- **MxToolbox**: Checks the email sender's authenticity.
- **RMail**: Demonstrates email encryption for security.

## Screenshots:

## Future Improvements:
- Automate phishing detection with Python scripts.
- Implement a real-time phishing alert system for email clients.
